Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - runtime files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) utilities
 Television broadcasts use the VBI to transmit text such as closed captioning
 (NTSC), Teletext (PAL/SECAM), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet
 television encodings.  The zvbi library is used to capture and decode raw
 VBI data.
 .
 This package contains the following utilities:
  * zvbid, a proxy for VBI devices. It forwards VBI data streams to one or
    more connected clients and manages channel change requests.
  * zvbi-atsc-cc, a command-line utility that captures  ATSC TV transmissions
    using a Linux DVB device and decodes the enclosed Closed Caption data.
    It can record both NTSC caption (EIA 608-B) and DTVCC caption (CEA 708-C).
  * zvbi-chains, a wrapper which executes the VBI application given on the
    command line while overloading several C library calls so that the
    application can be forced to access VBI devices via the VBI proxy instead
    of device files directly.
  * zvbi-ntsc-cc, a command-line utility for decoding and capturing closed
    captioning (CC) for NTSC and webtv.
